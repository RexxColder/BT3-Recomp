# Build a **portable** Linux release against glibc 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04), so the packaged
# `bt3-runner`/`Launcher` run on Ubuntu/Kubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 (glibc 2.35 / 2.39) and other
# distros with glibc >= 2.35.
#
# Why: a native build inherits the build host's glibc. Building on a rolling distro (e.g. Arch,
# glibc 2.44) produces a binary that needs GLIBC_2.4x and aborts on 24.04 with:
#     libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.43' not found (required by bt3-runner)
# Self-builds on the user's own distro are unaffected (they use their own glibc); this wrapper is
# only for producing a distributable artifact.
#
# Requires a container engine (docker, or podman via CONTAINER_ENGINE). Pass the ISO and any
# games/bt3/setup.py flag through:
#     scripts/build-linux-portable.sh /path/to/bt3-usa.iso --jobs 8
