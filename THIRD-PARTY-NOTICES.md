# Third-party notices

BT3-Recomp bundles or builds against the third-party components listed below.
This file is a summary for attribution; the **full license texts** ship with each
component and at the links provided. Nothing here is game content — the game is
recompiled at build time from the user's own disc dump.

If you redistribute a release, keep this file (and the license texts it points
to) alongside it.

## Project license

BT3-Recomp is **GPL-3.0** (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)). Because it is built on
[PS2Recomp](https://github.com/ran-j/PS2Recomp) (GPL-3.0) and combines
[paraLLEl-GS](https://github.com/Arntzen-Software/parallel-gs)
(LGPL-3.0-or-later), the combined work is distributed under **GPL-3.0**.
